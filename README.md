# PhoneGap Shared Image Plugin
By Leonard Lin

This plugin will allow your app to receive shared image intents easily.

## Requirements
This plugin has been tested to work w/ [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/download) 2.1.0

## Installing the Plugin

Copy `src` and `assets` into your project folders. This is the plugin.

Update `<plugins>` in your `res/xml/config.xml`:

    <plugin name="SharedImage" value="com.lensley.phonegap.SharedImage" />


## Usage

First you'll need to install the appropriate Intent in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

    <intent-filter>
      <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
      <data android:mimeType="image/*" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    </intent-filter>


Then in your PhoneGap app, add a Handler (put this in your `deviceready` callback):

    sharedimage.shared(function(e) {
      // the media uri - e.img is the only attribute
      console.log("IMAGE: " + e.img);

      // actual file name
      window.resolveLocalFileSystemURI(e.img, function(imgfile) {
        console.log("FILENAME: " + imgfile.name);
      });
    });

That's about it.

## Mentions

The skeleton of the code was pulled from [phonegap-nfc](https://github.com/chariotsolutions/phonegap-nfc). I wrote this because [WebIntent](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/Android/WebIntent) was bugging out in conjunction with phonegap-nfc.
